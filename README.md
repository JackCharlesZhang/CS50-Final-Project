Hello, this is my final project called Sponsorpedia. Sponsorpedia is a website where users can sponsor, comment on, and review different programs and projects.
This website is really similar to GoFundMe, except GoFundMe is predominantly for individuals and private institutions and groups to be sponsored, while Sponsorpedia
is for the public sector. For example, a local community development project could be pitched at Sponsorpedia, and community members could sponsor the program. I chose this specific project because
I believe there is a huge disconnect between local government and citizens, and therefore, beneficial social projects will often be overlooked, unless there is a website where all of them can be centralized.

When you first arrive at the page, you can search for a public program by title. A list of options will appear, with their names, locations, and types, and you can select one to read up on it. You can also
register your own program with a name, location, type, and description, but it cannot have the same name as a previous program. You can write reviews for programs and can comment and give 0-5 stars. The average rating
will be displayed. Anyone can do this.

If you register for an account and login, however, you will gain 3 new functions. You can sponsor a program by typing in its name and selecting an amount to donate,
you can add funds to your account, and you can track the history of your transactions. Essentially, money can only be handled when you log in. For the sake of the project,
you start with 10,000 dollars, which is a lot, but you can always add more using add funds.

Each program has a unique id, which is used in registering the program, accessing it, writing a review, and sponsoring it. This is hidden in the database.

I hope you enjoy using the website!
